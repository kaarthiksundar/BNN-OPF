## üìò Overview

The BNN-OPF framework addresses the challenge of learning optimization proxies for constrained problems like Optimal Power Flow (OPF) under limited labeled data and training time. It employs a semi-supervised Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) that alternates between supervised learning (minimizing cost) and unsupervised learning (enforcing constraint feasibility). This approach provides probabilistic confidence bounds on performance, making it suitable for safety-critical applications.
